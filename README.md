# Airsonic Web Client [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/heyarne/airsonic-ui.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/heyarne/airsonic-ui) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/heyarne/airsonic-ui.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This repository contains an alternative web frontend for [airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic). The goal is to eventually be able to fully replace the current web interface.

## Implemented So Far

* Login with persisting credentials
* Browse your library by newest / most recently played / starred
* Browse artists alphabetically
* A currently playing queue with next, previous, repeat and shuffle
* Information about the current track with the ability to seek

## How Do I Host This Myself?

There are two options:

- You build it yourself by cloning the repository and running `npm run build`
- You grab a pre-built version from the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/heyarne/airsonic-ui/tree/gh-pages) (just click the download button)

The files you receive either way should be identical. There's [an article about setting up nginx](https://github.com/heyarne/airsonic-ui/wiki/Self%E2%80%93hosting) in the repository wiki.

If you have any questions please ask them in the [airsonic matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#airsonic:matrix.org).

## Development

The project is written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) and uses [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for structure and peace of mind. The build tool is [shadow-cljs](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html), which offers nice editor integration and interoparibility with the whole JavaScript ecosystem.
If you haven't worked with re-frame: I highly recommend it. Good resources are the project's [docs](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/tree/master/docs) and a [post about its building blocks](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/re-frame-building-blocks/).

To build the project make sure you have Node.js (v22.0.0), npm, [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr) and Java 8 installed in your system.

```
# after cloning the project, first install all dependencies
$ npm install

# start a continuous build with hot-code-reloading and continuous testing
# first build takes a while. open http://localhost:8080
$ npm run dev
```

All other build tasks are defined in the `package.json` (more below).

### Editor Integration

Integrating shadow-cljs with your editor helps tremendously with development. After having run `npm run dev` as described above you can connect to the REPL and get features like in-editor code execution and code completion / documentation lookup. For further information see [this part of the shadow-cljs user guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_editor_integration). Recommended editors and plugins are Calva for VSCode and CIDER for Emacs (comes with Spacemacs). Make sure to open `localhost:8080` in the browser after starting the `dev:cljs` task to execute ClojureScript code in a live REPL.

### re-frame-10x

re-frame-10x is a debugger that is bundled with the app in development mode. Once you have the build running, hit `Ctrl + h` and the re-frame-10x window will show up:

![re-frame-10x in action](./docs/re-frame-10x.png)

It provides you with tools to inspect the state of the application, undo and replay events, debug performance issues and more.

## Tests

This project uses [karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) for tests. There is a check inside `karma.conf.js` to see whether Firefox is installed (via `which firefox` which probably breaks on Windows ðŸ¤·); if that command doesn't fail it will be used as the test runner. Otherwise Chrome will be used. If you have Chromium installed, make sure to set the `CHROME_BIN` environment variable to point to Chromium.

```
# run tests once
$ npm test
```

**Note:** If you want nice console output in your tests, make sure to `(enable-console-print!)`. You can call `println` afterwards like you're used to.

## Deployment

```
# build and optimize the code once for production
$ npm run build

# publishes everything via gh-pages
$ npm run deploy
```

There is continuous deployment set up on [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/heyarne/airsonic-ui) that builds and deploys to `gh-pages` after a commit to the `master` branch.

**Note:** If you have a continuous build running and run `npm run build` or `npm run deploy`, it will delete the compiled tests, causing the continuous tests to not run anymore. This can be fixed by running `npm test` again.

All build artifacts land in `/public`. Don't change anything in there as changes will be overwritten.
